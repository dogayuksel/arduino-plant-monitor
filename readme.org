* Introduction
  An arduino based soil moisture tracker.
  
* Components 
  - Two humidity sensors
  - Arduino UNO
  - Arduino WiFi shield
  - Nodejs server
  - Firebase Database
  - Simple Dashboard based on d3.js

* Demo

* Configuration
- Get the `serviceAccountKey.json` from Firebase console and place on project root.
- Copy `.env` to `.env.dev` (`.env.prod` etc.) and fill in values.
- Run the following commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source .env.dev
make
#+END_SRC

* Running
- Run Arduino IDE and upload generated sketch to the board.
- Run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make serve
#+END_SRC

At this point, arduino board should connect to your wifi and start sending measurements to the node server. Similarly the node server should be serving the dashboard when you visits its url on a browser. Dashboard requests data from the server which in return is queries against the firebase realtime database.
